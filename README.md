# Verifiable Credential Transparency

The Verifiable Credential Transparency (VCT) is based on certificate transparency [RFC6962](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6962).
The Credentials are included into VCT as append-only [Merkle Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree) logs.
VCT uses the existing Merkle Tree implementation provided by [Trillian](https://github.com/google/trillian).
VCT was created for the [orb](https://github.com/trustbloc/orb#orb-did-method) project and its usage is described [here](https://trustbloc.github.io/did-method-orb/#witness-ledger).

## Build and test

To build and test VCT you need:

* Go 1.16 or later
* GNU Make
* Bash
* Docker and Docker-Compose

Run tests:

```make unit-test bdd-test```

## Deploy

VCT itself is a compound of three essential components.

* log-server
* log-signer
* vct

To deploy the service you would need to build them first.

`make build-vct build-log-server build-log-signer`

1. Run the log-server.

Log server depends on the database. To run DB you can simply use `docker-compose` for that.

NOTE: We support MySQL and Postgres. If you run your own DB service, do not forget to import schema.
See [MySQL schema](https://github.com/trustbloc/vct/blob/main/test/bdd/fixtures/vct/mysql-config/mysql_config.sql)
and [Postgres schema](https://github.com/trustbloc/vct/blob/main/test/bdd/fixtures/vct/postgres-config/postgres_config.sql).

Run `Postgres` by using `docker-compose`:

`cd ./test/bdd/fixtures/vct && docker-compose up vct.postgres`

Then run the log-server.

`./build/bin/log-server --pg_conn_str="user=postgres host=localhost password=password dbname=test port=5432 sslmode=disable" --storage_system=postgres -quota_system=noop`

Log server will start the RPC server on `localhost:8090` and  HTTP server on `localhost:8091`.

Use help flag to find out all available flags `./build/bin/log-server -h`.

2. Run the log-signer.

Log signer must be run with the same DB configuration as a `log-server`.
Log signer will start the RPC server on `localhost:8090` and  HTTP server on `localhost:8091`.
Since those ports are already occupied by the `log-server`, let's change them.

`./build/bin/log-signer --pg_conn_str="user=postgres host=localhost password=password dbname=test port=5432 sslmode=disable" --storage_system=postgres --force_master=true --h
ttp_endpoint=0.0.0.0:8099 --rpc_endpoint=0.0.0.0:8098 --quota_system=noop`

Use help flag to find out all available flags `./build/bin/log-signer -h`.

3.  Run the vct.

` ./build/bin/vct start --logs=maple2021:rw@127.0.0.1:8090`

The required argument here is `--logs`. It specifies an alias for the log, permissions and `log-service` RPC endpoint.
For example, if we want to change logs yearly we can do the following:
`--logs=maple2020:r@127.0.0.1:8090,maple2021:rw@127.0.0.1:8090`

An alias (e.g maple2021) can be any string and it will represent a log-id.
When an alias (e.g maple2021) is provided the service will try to get the correlated log-id from the DB,
if the record does not exist the service will create a new log-id and it will be assigned to the given alias.
The database can be specified by using the `--dsn` argument.

The vct server by default will be run on `localhost:5678`.

Use help flag to find out all available flags `./build/bin/vct -h`.

## Configuration

To get help about startup options use the following command:

```$ ./build/bin/vct start -h```
The output should be similar to this:

```

Usage:
  vct start [flags]

Alternatively, this can be set with the following environment variable: VCT_DSN (default "mem://test")
  -h, --help                        help for start
      --issuers string              Comma-Separated list of supported issuers. Alternatively, this can be set with the following environment variable: VCT_ISSUERS
  -s, --kms-endpoint string         Remote KMS URL. Alternatively, this can be set with the following environment variable: VCT_KMS_ENDPOINT
  -l, --logs string                 Trillian logs comma separated.  Format must be <alias>:<permission>@<endpoint>. Examples: maple2021:rw@server.com,maple2020:r@server.com:9890 Alternatively, this can be set with the following environment variable: VCT_LOGS
      --sync-timeout string         Total time in seconds to resolve config values. Alternatively, this can be set with the following environment variable: VCT_SYNC_TIMEOUT (default "3")
      --timeout string              Total time in seconds to wait until the services are available before giving up. Alternatively, this can be set with the following environment variable: VCT_TIMEOUT (default "0")
      --tls-cacerts string          Comma-Separated list of ca certs path. Alternatively, this can be set with the following environment variable: VCT_TLS_CACERTS
      --tls-serve-cert string       Path to the server certificate to use when serving HTTPS. Alternatively, this can be set with the following environment variable: VCT_TLS_SERVE_CERT
      --tls-serve-key string        Path to the private key to use when serving HTTPS. Alternatively, this can be set with the following environment variable: VCT_TLS_SERVE_KEY
      --tls-systemcertpool string   Use system certificate pool. Possible values [true] [false]. Defaults to false if not set. Alternatively, this can be set with the following environment variable: VCT_TLS_SYSTEMCERTPOOL (default "false")
```

Each parameter has a description. It should not be hard to start a service.
Only one parameter is required to launch a service and requires extra explanation.
This is `--logs` flag. It describes the ledger per tenant.

For example, let's take a look at the following configuration:

e.g  `--logs=maple2020:rw@127.0.0.1:8090,maple2021:rw@127.0.0.1:8090`

It means that we have two tenants (maple2020 and maple2021).
Both of them have read/write permissions(rw) and they are using the same Trillian log server (127.0.0.1:8090).
You can set permissions to `r,w` or `rw`. e.g `maple2020:r@127.0.0.1:8090` (only read).
Under the hood, the service will create a new log id per tenant and map it to its alias.
e.g `maple2020` might be mapped to `11715276152711`.
Where `11715276152711` is created by Trillian.
That correlation will be stored in the DB. So, next time when vct service will be up and running we will not create a new log id.

VCT depends on [Trillian log server/signer](https://github.com/google/trillian).
Deployment should be done similar to [trillian deployments](https://github.com/google/trillian/tree/master/deployment#trillian-supported-deployments).

## Databases

### VCT Storage

VCT uses Aries generic storage interface for storing data.
Backup should be done similarly to other trustbloc projects.
In VCT we support the following databases:
* CouchDB
* MySQL
* Memory (backup is not supported)

Use the database-specific command to get all databases and filter them by `VCT_DATABASE_PREFIX` env.

For instance, to get all databases for CouchDB use the following command:
```
curl -X GET http://admin:password@127.0.0.1:5984/_all_dbs
```
Output:
```
["_replicator","_users","kmspkprimarykey","vctdbmaple2021jsonldcontexts","vctdbconfig"]
```

Then, filter databases from the output above by `VCT_DATABASE_PREFIX=vctdb` env.
Databases we need to backup are `vctdbmaple2021jsonldcontexts` and `vctdbconfig`
Make a backup according to CouchDB documentation.

### Trillian Storage

For Trillian we support the following databases:
* Postgres
* MySQL

Backup should be done according to the official documentation (Postgres or MySQL).

See schemas for better understanding:
* [MySQL schema](https://github.com/trustbloc/vct/blob/main/test/bdd/fixtures/vct/mysql-config/mysql_config.sql)
* [Postgres schema](https://github.com/trustbloc/vct/blob/main/test/bdd/fixtures/vct/postgres-config/postgres_config.sql).

Note: If you want to restore a backup from the ground up make sure that schema was imported first.
